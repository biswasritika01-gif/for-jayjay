    const text = `A paragraph could never do justice to the way I feel about you, but nevertheless, here we go.

I know it hasn’t been long since we’ve known each other, yet somehow it feels like I’ve known you forever.

I probably don’t say this enough, but I’m truly glad I met you (even if we did meet in a slightly unconventional way haha <3).

I still remember the first time I saw you. My heart felt like it was beating out of my chest; something I’ve never experienced before. But the moment you looked up from your phone and smiled at me, a wave of serenity washed over me, as if I was ready to surrender to the tide… to you.

Thank you for calling me every day, even on the days you’re exhausted.
Thank you for all the cute gifts.
Thank you for dealing with all my shenanigans.
Thank you for choosing to love me despite my flaws and imperfections.
Thank you for treating me with kindness and empathy.
Thank you for creating a space where I can be my truest self.
Thank you for being my home.

And last, but never least, thank you for simply being you.

If someone had told me earlier that all the heartbreaks would eventually lead me to you, I would have gone through every one of them again in the blink of an eye.

For the first time in my life, I’ve found someone I’d be truly scared to lose and so I choose to hold on to this feeling, to not let go of you.

I sincerely wish for you to achieve everything you desire in this life. Just know that I’ll always be cheering for you, both in silence and in chaos.

Wishing you the happiest birthday, JayJay.
I love you. I miss you so much.

And I’m manifesting that the next time, we get to celebrate your birthday together, in person. 🤍`;
